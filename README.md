---------------------------------------
<>index.html
- changed title of website to something more descriptive
- added descriptive alt tags to images
- added descriptive alt tags to links (although read this may not be necessary if the text that follows is descriptive, did it just in case)

---------------------------------------
#style.css
- Rearranged elements so they are ordered to follow the semantic structure of the HTML
- Consolidated elements that had the same attributes removing redundant coding
- left comments in CSS file to changes made
- set min-width on .content & .benefits so that they don't become unreadable when shrunk.
- added a hover color to more distinguish the links
